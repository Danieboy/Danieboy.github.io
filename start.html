</br>
My name is Dan Andersson and I am 24 years old.
I am currently living in Helsingborg (Skane, Sweden) where I am employed at <a href="http://www.nowaste.se/"> Nowaste Logistics AB</a>. </br>
I finished my studies at the Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University at Campus Helsingborg with a bachelor's degree in computer science.
In short it's a broad education that is mostly centered around the development of software, websites or applications for Android phones.
</br></br>
I spent my last year of my education at a company called Markettime AB, where I have worked with my bachelor's thesis and has been a web developer for a service that the company offers, <a href="http://test2.markettools.se/"> Markettools</a>, 
which is developed in ASP.net (C #, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, SQL) and I thought it was very interesting to see how that worked.
</br></br>
In my spare time I go to the gym, go swimming and meet friends depending on how much time I have to spare. Last year I was also the IT manager for HelsingborgsSpexet, which is a non-profit organization based around students at Campus Helsingborg.
Information about that can be found at: <a href="http://www.helsingborgsspexet.se/"> Helsingborgsspexet.se (Swedish)</a>
As an IT manager, I look after the website, is in charge of communication (email to both students, partners and social media) and is on the board.
</br></br>
My current goal is to make my mark in the industry and being able to make a living out of something I really enjoy doing - programming and working in a team.
As a long term goal I would really want to become some kind of a project manager because it's something that I really enjoyed doing and had good results with during my education in projects in the school and on companies.
