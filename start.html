</br>
Hello there!
</br></br>
My name is Dan Andersson and I am 23 years old.
I am currently living in Klippan (Skåne, Sweden), but I've got plans to move as soon as possible depending on when and where I land my next job.
I studied at the Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University at their Campus Helsingborg for a bachelor's degree in computer science, in short it's a broad education that is most centered around the development of software, websites or applications for Android phones.
</br></br>
The past year I have spent at a company called Markettime AB, where I have worked with my bachelor's thesis and has been a web developer for a service that the company offers, www.markettools.se, which is developed in ASP.net (C #, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, SQL) and I thought it was very interesting to see how that worked.
Now I'm employed by the hour at Diflex AB so they call me when needed for a project.
I also have a drivers license and usually have access to a car if needed through my parents, but plan to buy a car in the near future.
</br></br>
In my spare time I go to the gym, depending on how much time I have over. I am also the IT manager for HelsingborgsSpexet, which is a non-profit organization based around students at Campus Helsingborg.
I also develop some Android applications for fun which can be seen in the "My Projects" tab at the top of this webpage.
Information about that can be found at:

<a href="http://www.helsingborgsspexet.se/"> Helsingborgsspexet.se (Swedish)</a>
</br></br>
As an IT manager, I look after the website, is in charge of communication (email to both students, partners and social media) and is on the board.
For the moment I am trying to build my portfolio by doing projects such as an Android application and this personal homepage.
</br></br>
My current goal is to get my foot in the industry and being able to make a living out of something I really enjoy doing - programming and working in a team.
As a long term goal I would really want to become some kind of a project manager because it's something that I really enjoyed doing and had good results with during my education in projects in the school and on companies.
